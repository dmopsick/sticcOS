Hello Alan - please grade `MASTER` when the time comes. I will be working on different branches for each projects and committing into `MASTER` when I reach good progress points.

Hi Alan - Thanks for good semester. I did not do rolling in and out for project 4 because I just ran out of time and I decided to lose that 70 points, hate to see it but is what it is :) Have good holiday!
